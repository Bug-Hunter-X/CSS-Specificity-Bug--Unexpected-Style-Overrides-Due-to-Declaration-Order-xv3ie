The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to the specificity of CSS selectors:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

.myClass div {
  color: red;
}

#myID div {
  color: green;
}

#myID.myClass div {
  color: purple;
}

<div id="myID" class="myClass"></div>
```

The issue is that while it appears that `#myID.myClass div` should override the styles in `#myID div` and `.myClass div` due to its higher specificity (combining ID and class selectors),  the order of appearance in the CSS also matters.  In this example, if the `#myID div` style is declared *after* `#myID.myClass div`, the green color will override the purple color, even though `#myID.myClass div` is more specific.

This happens because CSS specificity calculation will prioritize the more specific selector (`#myID.myClass div`) but the later appearance in the CSS stylesheet will cause the `#myID div` rule to be applied if it is declared after the more specific rule.

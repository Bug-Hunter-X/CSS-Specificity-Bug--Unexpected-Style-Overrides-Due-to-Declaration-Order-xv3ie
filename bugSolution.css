The solution is to reorder the CSS rules so that the most specific selector appears first:

```css
#myID.myClass div {
  color: purple;
}

#myID div {
  color: green;
}

.myClass div {
  color: red;
}

div {
  color: blue;
}

```

By placing `#myID.myClass div` before `#myID div`, the more specific rule will always be applied regardless of the specificity calculation, thus fixing the bug.
